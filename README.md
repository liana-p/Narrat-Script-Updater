## Narrat script updater

Script that tries to update narrat script syntax (especially relating to how condition syntax has changed)

**Make a backup before running!!!!**

1. Place your scripts in the scripts folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `node index.js`, it will go through and update your scripts.

Preferable, give a look at the before-after diff on git to see if there are any issues and fix advanced cases the script couldn't fix
